## PSC Vote Linker


</div>

### Description

Well this is the code for you! If you are a PSC Code contributor, you know that after downloading your code people seldom comes to vote. It's because people forget the link and never bothers to find it again. That's why I have made this for you...

Now This User Control(PSCVOTE) makes it so easy for people to reach your code's voting

page at anytime from anywhere. What you need to do is keep this user control in your

project and use it wherever you wish.

Enjoy those GREAT Votes!
