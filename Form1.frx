ÿ€Well this is the code for you! If you are a PSC Code contributor, you know that after 
downloading your code people seldom comes to vote. It's because people forget the 
link and never bothers to find it again. That's why I have made this for you... 

Now This User Control(PSCVOTE) makes it so easy for people to reach your code's voting 
page at anytime from anywhere. What you need to do is keep this user control in your 
project and use it wherever you wish. 

Your voting page will be just a click away!

Note: Please note that the code you submit should be compressed in a way that the 
PSC Read Me file should be in the App.path directory.

For Example, If your project's path is "C:\My Projects\Project1\Project.vbp" , then you 
should compress the folder 'Project1' not 'My Projects'

The reason is that 'GetURL' function in the UserControl looks for PSC README file in 
App.path and if you compressed 'My Projects' (or any parent folder of App.path) , the PSC 
ReadMe file will be placed in the 'My Projects' folder(or the parent folder you compressed) 
not inside App.path. 

So take care not to keep any Parent Folder to your App.path in the submitted ZIP file.

Also note that you should not have any text file that resembles the file name 
"@PSC_ReadMe_"

Now try clicking 'VOTE NOW!'  it will take you to my voting page and it will work for you 
too.

Enjoy it!
